2025-03-02 02:13:39.738109: W tensorflow/compiler/tf2tensorrt/utils/py_utils.cc:38] TF-TRT Warning: Could not find TensorRT
/home/cosine/.conda/envs/trainer/lib/python3.11/site-packages/coffea/nanoevents/methods/candidate.py:11: FutureWarning: In version 2024.7.0 (target date: 2024-06-30 11:59:59-05:00), this will be an error.
To raise these warnings as errors (and get stack traces to find out where they're called), run
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings("error", module="coffea.*")
after the first `import coffea` or use `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings("error:::coffea.*")` in pytest.
Issue: coffea.nanoevents.methods.vector will be removed and replaced with scikit-hep vector. Nanoevents schemas internal to coffea will be migrated. Otherwise please consider using that package!.
